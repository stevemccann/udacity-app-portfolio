App portfolio create for Android Nanodegree

With my initial design I was trying to replicate the UI of the play store, which gives a nice quick-glance icon view along with a text description. The list of apps is currently not implemented as an adapter and does not allow scrolling, so in landscape mode the list currently gets cut off and does not scroll.
